All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. As the minimum age for Reddit access is [13 years old](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/7h5xr7/is_there_a_age_limit_for_reddit/dqodxmb), posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed.|\n|2. No memes, and no HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, or DAE posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. Non-memetic image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [KarmaDecay](http://www.karmadecay.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, no hate speech, no harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles. (See below.)|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. Emoji-based titles, memetic titles, and titles meant to circumvent any other rules are also forbidden.|\n|7. No gore, pornography, or sexually graphic images.|Try /r/NSFWfunny. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. Do not rehost or hotlink webcomics.|If you are not the author of the comic in question, you may only submit links to the page where it is hosted. Webcomic authors may [request verification](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/comicauthor) from the moderators, after which they may rehost their own work.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No SMS or social media content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, or any form of \"comments section\" on the Internet, as well as [content accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed.

Direct links to major video sites are preferred (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)\n\n---\n###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) \n\n#0. Videos Only\n* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.\n\n*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos\n\n#1. No Politics\n* Political videos—including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)—should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. \n\n* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)\n\n#2. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting\n* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**\n\n* No demanding \"Reddit Justice\" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.\n\n* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.\n\n* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.\n\n* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.\n\n* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**\n\n#3. Submit Direct Link to Video\n\n* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. \n\n* No URL shorteners. \n\n* No links to playlists or to channel pages.\n\n#4. No Porn, Gore, or Death.\n\n* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.\n\n#5. No Solicitation of Votes or Views\n\n* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.\n\n* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.\n\n* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like \"this person deserves more views,\" \"not enough people have seen this person's videos,\" or \"show this person some love.\"\n\n* Giveaways also fall under this rule\n\n* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.\n\n#6. No Hate Speech\n\n* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.\n\n* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**\n\n* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.\n\n* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)\n\n#7. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts\n\n* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. \n\n* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.\n\n* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.\n\n* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.\n\n* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout\n\n#8. No Third Party Licensing\n\n* No videos that are licensed by a third party. \n\n* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. \n\n* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.\n\n* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams.

Just because something bad happened to you doesn't mean it's a fuck up.\n> -  **TIFU** must be at the beginning of the post title or it will automatically be removed. \n> - **TIFUpdate** if you are posting a follow-up post to update us on your story. \n\n######[](#space)\n\n> ### Uninspired, lacking in context, literal shitpost, overly vulgar and glorifying illegal activities posts may be removed at mods discretion\n> - **Uninspired** as in something that is super common, lacking in imagination or originality.\n> - **Context** as in the story doesn't have any more info beyond the title. *note*: All posts must contain at least 750 characters of meaningful content.\n> - **Shitpost** as in literally involving defecation or other bodily fluids.\n> - **Overly vulgar** includes obscene situations, such as, but not limited to, incest, minors, death and assault to humans and animals. Consensual situations between two, unrelated adults should be fine. Vulgar does not mean using bad words. \n> - **Illegal activities** that you glorify or giving advice on how to do something illegal.\n> - **Not Your Fault** as in it was just something bad that happened to you; if it wasn't directly your fault, it wasn't your fuckup.\n\n######[](#space)\n\n> ### All posts must end with a TL;DR and tag NSFW when necessary \n> - **TL;DR** or too long didn't read which is a summarization of your post in a few bitesize sentence. At minimum, your TL;DR summary must contain your fuckup and its consequences. You may include additional information if you'd like. The TL;DR must be at the very end of your post.\n> - **NSFW** or not safe for work. If you're not sure if it's NSFW or not, better to be safe than sorry. \n\n######[](#space)\n\n> ### Be civil and don't be disruptive\n> - **Be civil** means don't do these things; personal attacks, harassment,  trolling, and bigotry. Use your better judgement. \n> - **Disruptive** such as posting, or seeking, any identifying personal information (real/fake). This includes yourself or others, and refers, but is not limited to, names, phone numbers, email addresses, or any social media accounts. As well as brigading with either votes or comments.\n\n######[](#space)\n\n> ### No spam, bots or advertising\n> - **Spam**, don't link to things that you may or may not be rewarded for. Posting links of you narrating a story is considered spam.\n> - **Bots** are annoying and will be banned.\n> - **Advertising**, we are not a platform for you (patreon or charities) or your products, seek https://www.redditinc.com/advertising instead.\n\n## Notes\n#### Moderators reserve the right to remove threads or ban users for any of the above rule violations. \n#### If your post has been removed please [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftifu) directly for an appeal, do not repost your thread.

Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives.\n\nThis rule applies to everyone (even those outside of Reddit). Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\n\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n\n##2. Voting Rules\n\nUpvote posts that are appropriate for this sub or that you think make for an interesting discussion. PLEASE DO NOT downvote if you think OP is an asshole, go to the comments section and call him an asshole like a civilized person.\n\nIn the comments, upvote any comment that gives the correct judgment of the situation. DO NOT downvote people for disagreeing with you or for merely commenting on their own post unless they are being abusive or argumentative.\n\n##3. Accept Your Judgment\n\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n\n##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\n\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun, even if it's not going well for you. People will come back to see what consensus was reached in your thread. If you erase a discussion because you don't like the way it's going, that is extremely frustrating to everyone who has taken an interest in the topic. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n\n##5. No Violence\n\nDon't even *mention* violence.\n\nIf your post references violence, don't share it here. Threads which mention violence are difficult to moderate, we have to remove all comments which encourage or incite violence. It's difficult to do this in a thread which discusses violence.\n\nComments and even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited. **This is a zero tolerance policy.** \n\n##6. How To Post\n\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\n\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here.\n\n##7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\n\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\n\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n\n##8. No Shitposts\n\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible.\n\nThis is not a humor sub. This is not a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, or creative writing exercises. Don't copy someone else's story and post it from the opposite viewpoint or with some details changed.\n\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n\n##9. Do Not Ask For Advice\n\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\n\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\n\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n\n##10. Meta Posts and Updates Require Permission\n\nIf you want to talk about the sub, and you hide your complaint, question, or opinion in a post that starts with AITA, you will be banned. Those are called META posts, and they must have a title that starts with META.\n\nPlease request mod approval after you submit your META post or your update post. Make sure the title of your meta post starts with META and the title of your update post starts with UPDATE. See our FAQ for more guidelines.\n\n##11. No breakups/hookups\n\nWe do not allow submissions where the central conflict is a relationship and instead recommend a relationship focused sub.\n\nThe following posts are forever banned:\n\nAITA for breaking up with _ (or not)\n\nAITA for dating _ (or not)\n\nAITA for doing sexual act _ (or not)\n\nAITA for being attracted to _ (or not)\n\nAnd any discussions related to cheating- including \"telling on\" someone for cheating (or not doing so).\n\nAnd similar discussions.\n\n##12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\n\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue, it is not appropriate for this sub. This may include anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to not support a political candidate, kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any number of similar debate threads, your post will be removed.\n\n##13. No Revenge Stories\n\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n\n##14. Comments and Flairing\n\nAfter 18 hours, the post will be assigned a flair representing the sub's judgment. The flair will be decided by the top comment of the post. OPs should expect questions and should answer them within the 18 hour period.\n\nIf you are commenting, be sure to start your comment with the abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.\n\n**YTA** = You're the Asshole; \n\n**NTA** = Not the A-hole; \n\n**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;\n \n**NAH** = No A-holes here; \n\n**INFO** = Not Enough Info \n\n##15. User Flairs\n\nWe award flairs for community members who distinguish themselves in their mastery of asshole judgment. If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point.

No [Bad Faith Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/wiki/bfp).\n \n3.) No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. \n \n4.) **No Racism**. No hate speech. No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.\n \n5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).\n\n6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for [annoying redditisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/dxzhp13/), such as linking a subreddit as a reply to a post/comment.\n\n7.) **Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed**. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.\n\n8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add \"bruh\", \"fam\", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.\n\n9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking \"what does x mean?\" will be removed. \n\n\n10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.\n \n11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts. Posts must come from regular social media accounts.  \n\n12.) **The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.**\n\n---\n---\n**Also, join us on discord for exciting discussions:** \n\n**www.discord.gg/BPD**\n\n---\n\n☑️**Friends**☑️\n\n* /r/BPTmeta\n\n* /r/blackpeoplegifs \n\n* /r/wholesomebpt\n\n* /r/memesofanime\n\n* /r/bestoftwitter\n\n* /r/WhitePeopleFacebook \n\n* /r/indianpeoplefacebook\n\n* /r/oldpeoplefacebook\n\n* /r/blackpeoplevines\n\n* /r/bptcirclejerk\n\n* /r/RussiansOnTheInternet\n\n* /r/LatinoPeopleTwitter\n\n* /r/BikiniBottomTwitter \n\n* /r/NSFWTwitterReplies\n\n* /r/saiyanpeopletwitter", "public_description": "Screenshots of Black people being hilarious or insightful on social media, it doesn't need to just be twitter but obviously that is best."}, {"id": "2qh72", "name": "t5_2qh72", "over18": false, "icon_size": null, "key_color": "#a5a4a4", "description": "Welcome to /r/Jokes!\n\n**Guidelines and Information**\n\n- Offensive jokes are fine as long as they are still jokes.

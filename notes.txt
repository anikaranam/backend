- application and query uuids, assume application and query names will be unique?
    - can enforce unique names from backend (throw error if name exists already)
- full-schema causing crash



remaining work:
    - add endpoints for swagger files and translation file management in the backend
    - testing
    - implement and test toGraphQLstring function
    - error handling in backend
    - refresh token and access token management

- application and query uuids, assume application and query names will be unique?
    - can enforce unique names from backend (throw error if name exists already)
- full-schema causing crash



remaining work:
    - add endpoints for swagger files and translation file management in the backend
        - translation tool : add interface for managing files
        - version control
    - testing
    - implement and test toGraphQLstring function
    - error handling in backend
    - refresh token and access token management
    - experiment with finding way to convert schema to javascript files
    - refactor backend to different controllers instead of having everything in server.js

- field error:
    - form
- general error
    - everythign else

Hang:
    - cascade delete
    - full-schema bug
    - icons
